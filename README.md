## Introduction

The TastyIgniter Broadcast extension leverages [Laravel Broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting) to deliver real-time browser notifications in response to specific events within TastyIgniter. This extension allows you to broadcast system events such as order status updates, reservation notifications, and more to your TastyIgniter website.

While the extension is designed to integrate with the [Pusher service](https://pusher.com/), it also supports other Laravel broadcast drivers.
